# Part 23 — How to View Multiple Excel Files Side by Side

## Overview
Analysts frequently need to compare two workbooks or two sections of the same workbook simultaneously. Excel's window management features make side-by-side comparison seamless — without copying data between files.

## View Two Workbooks Side by Side
1. Open both workbooks
2. **View -> View Side by Side**
3. Excel tiles the two windows horizontally
4. Enable **Synchronous Scrolling** (View ribbon) to scroll both windows at the same speed simultaneously

## Arrange Multiple Windows
**View -> Arrange All**
Choose: Tiled, Horizontal, Vertical, or Cascade
Useful when working with 3 or more workbooks at once.

## View Two Different Sheets from the SAME Workbook
This is the lesser-known but highly useful technique:
1. With the workbook open: **View -> New Window**
   Excel creates a second window of the exact same file
2. **View -> View Side by Side**
3. Navigate to a different sheet in each window
4. Any edit in either window is reflected in both (they are the same file)

## Reset Window Position
If the windows become misaligned: **View -> Reset Window Position**

## Switch Between Open Workbooks
- **View -> Switch Windows** -> click the workbook name
- **Keyboard**: Ctrl+F6 to cycle forward through open Excel workbooks

## Practical Use Cases
| Scenario | Solution |
|---|---|
| Compare Jan vs Feb data | Open both files -> View Side by Side |
| Check a formula references another sheet correctly | New Window -> two sheets side by side |
| Present current vs previous year | View Side by Side + Synchronous Scrolling |
| Copy data manually between two reports | Side by side saves Alt+Tab switching |

## Tip: Freeze Headers First
Before comparing large datasets, freeze the top row in both windows first so column headers remain visible while scrolling through the data.

## 🔄 Circular Learning Design

Each chapter loops back to earlier skills at a deeper level.

Example: When you learn **Power Query (Chapter 21)**, you revisit **Data Cleaning (Chapter 2)** — but now you apply it at enterprise scale using automated pipelines instead of manual steps.

This ensures **reinforcement + mastery**, not just exposure.

```
Ch 2: Data Cleaning (manual)
        ↓  revisited at deeper level
Ch 21: Power Query (automated cleaning pipelines)
        ↓  revisited at deeper level
Ch 22: Advanced Transformations (merge, pivot, unpivot, custom columns)
```

## 🏢 Real-World Example: Analyst at Swiggy

Imagine you are a Data Analyst at Swiggy. Here is exactly how you use Excel across the curriculum:

| Task | Chapter Used |
|---|---|
| Import 50,000 order records from the database | Chapter 10 — Data Import & Export |
| Clean messy customer names and phone numbers | Chapter 2 — Data Cleaning |
| Calculate delivery times using date/time formulas | Chapter 16 — Date & Time Functions |
| Build a PivotTable showing top 10 restaurants by orders | Chapter 8 — PivotTables |
| Create a revenue trend dashboard with slicers | Chapter 28 — Dashboards |
| Automate the weekly report with a macro | Chapter 44 — Macros Basics |
| Connect live data from the SQL database | Chapter 46 — Excel + SQL Integration |

This is exactly how Excel is used in real jobs — not in isolation, but as an end-to-end analytical tool.

## 🎯 How to Use These Notes

1. **Watch the video** for this part first — see the concept demonstrated live
2. **Read the notes** — they expand on everything shown in the video with more depth
3. **Try the examples** yourself in Excel as you read
4. **Complete the exercises** at the end of premium note sections
5. **Move to the next part** — each part builds on the previous one

💡 **Tip**: You do not need to memorise everything. Come back to these notes whenever you need a reference. The goal is to build understanding, not to memorise syntax.
