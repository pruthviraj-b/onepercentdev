# Part 14 — Master Excel Charts: Data to Visual Stories

## Overview
Charts transform numbers into insight. This part covers how to choose the right chart type for your data, build it correctly in seconds, and format it to a professional standard that communicates clearly.

## Chart Type Guide
| Chart | Best For |
|---|---|
| Column | Comparing values across categories |
| Bar | Horizontal comparison, long category names |
| Line | Trends and changes over time |
| Pie / Doughnut | Parts of a whole (maximum 5-6 slices) |
| Area | Cumulative volume over time |
| Scatter | Correlation between two numeric variables |
| Combo | Two different metrics on the same chart (e.g. Revenue + Growth %) |
| Histogram | Distribution and frequency of data |
| Waterfall | Running total or bridge chart (YTD variance) |
| Treemap | Hierarchical proportions (nested rectangles) |
| Funnel | Conversion rates through stages (sales pipeline) |

## Creating a Chart — Step by Step
1. Select your data range including headers
2. **Insert -> Recommended Charts** (Excel suggests based on your data)
3. Or choose directly from Insert -> Charts group
4. Excel inserts the chart as a floating object on the current sheet
5. To move to its own sheet: right-click chart -> **Move Chart -> New Sheet**

## Formatting a Professional Chart
- **Chart Title**: specific and clear — not "Chart 1" or "Sales Data"
- **Axis Labels**: always label units (Rs, %, days, units)
- **Legend**: position where it does not overlap data points
- **Data Labels**: show values on bars/lines when the axis alone is unclear
- **Gridlines**: horizontal only; remove vertical gridlines to reduce clutter
- **Colours**: maximum 3-4 colours; use brand colours if available
- **Font**: match the report font for consistency

## Editing Chart Data
Right-click the chart -> **Select Data**
- Add or remove series
- Rename series labels
- Swap rows and columns (Switch Row/Column button)

Or: drag the blue data selection border on the sheet to resize the range.

## Dynamic Charts — Link to a Table
If your source data is in an Excel Table (Ctrl+T), the chart automatically includes new rows when they are added. Always use Tables as chart sources for live reports.

## 🔄 Circular Learning Design

Each chapter loops back to earlier skills at a deeper level.

Example: When you learn **Power Query (Chapter 21)**, you revisit **Data Cleaning (Chapter 2)** — but now you apply it at enterprise scale using automated pipelines instead of manual steps.

This ensures **reinforcement + mastery**, not just exposure.

```
Ch 2: Data Cleaning (manual)
        ↓  revisited at deeper level
Ch 21: Power Query (automated cleaning pipelines)
        ↓  revisited at deeper level
Ch 22: Advanced Transformations (merge, pivot, unpivot, custom columns)
```
