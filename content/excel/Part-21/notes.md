# Part 21 — Row, Column, and Sheet Hiding and Unhiding in Excel

## Overview
Hidden rows, columns, and sheets are everywhere in professionally shared workbooks. This part covers how to hide and unhide all content — including the tricks people use to conceal data that the normal Unhide dialog will not reveal.

## Hiding Rows and Columns
Select rows or columns -> right-click -> **Hide**
Or: select -> Home -> Format -> Hide and Unhide

## Unhiding Rows
1. Select the row **above** AND the row **below** the hidden rows
2. Right-click -> **Unhide**

**Special case — Row 1 is hidden:**
- Click the Name Box (top-left) -> type `A1` -> press Enter
- Home -> Format -> Hide and Unhide -> **Unhide Rows**

## Unhiding Columns
1. Select the column to the **left** AND to the **right** of the hidden columns
2. Right-click -> **Unhide**

**Special case — Column A is hidden:**
- Name Box -> type `A1` -> Enter
- Home -> Format -> Hide and Unhide -> **Unhide Columns**

## Unhide ALL Hidden Rows or Columns at Once
1. **Ctrl+A** to select all cells
2. Right-click any row number -> Unhide
3. Right-click any column letter -> Unhide

## Sheet Hiding and Unhiding
**Hide**: right-click the sheet tab -> Hide
**Unhide**: right-click any visible sheet tab -> Unhide -> select sheet from the list -> OK

## Very Hidden Sheets (xlVeryHidden) — The Advanced Technique
Some sheets are hidden using VBA with `xlVeryHidden`. These do NOT appear in the normal Unhide dialog.

To reveal a Very Hidden sheet:
1. Press **Alt+F11** to open the VBA editor
2. In the Project Explorer panel (left side), find the hidden sheet
3. Press **F4** to open the Properties window
4. Change **Visible** from `xlSheetVeryHidden` to `xlSheetVisible`
5. Close the VBA editor

## Detecting Hidden Content
| Sign | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Row numbers skip (1,2,3 then 7) | Rows 4, 5, 6 are hidden |
| Column letters skip (A,B then E) | Columns C and D are hidden |
| Sheet tabs are missing | Sheets are hidden (normal or Very Hidden) |

## 🔄 Circular Learning Design

Each chapter loops back to earlier skills at a deeper level.

Example: When you learn **Power Query (Chapter 21)**, you revisit **Data Cleaning (Chapter 2)** — but now you apply it at enterprise scale using automated pipelines instead of manual steps.

This ensures **reinforcement + mastery**, not just exposure.

```
Ch 2: Data Cleaning (manual)
        ↓  revisited at deeper level
Ch 21: Power Query (automated cleaning pipelines)
        ↓  revisited at deeper level
Ch 22: Advanced Transformations (merge, pivot, unpivot, custom columns)
```
